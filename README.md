# TrackGreen

You all must be thinking that what is Track Green .
Actually, we thought to design a app/webapp by the help of machine learning and tensor flow.In our app we gonna train pur model to recognise the number of trees in a given area .
Recognising the area with greenery can help us in several ways like:-
 1: The house vs tree ratio.
 2: The ratio of planted and unplanted land.
 3: At very far sight it gonna help us in knowing the pollution and carbon sink in the particular area.

## Technologies we are using are:-
  * Tensor flow
  * OpenCV
  * Pre-trained model
  * Flutter,HTML,CSS,DJANGO
  * Invision for  - Prototype 

We are actually taking reference from several articles of google and other search engines.
we are also taking some theory data which tells about the average Carbon sink by a the defined area of trees.
we are also using pre-trained model from tensor flow using semantic-segmentation.


# Conclusion

  For several purposes we need such machine which can tell us about the details of the enviroment around us,number of tree we need to overcome the polluting state.
We have several other plans for the future but today we are working on the technology with which we are compatible.
